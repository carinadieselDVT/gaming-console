<!-- Project to build
   - Gamepad emulator
   - Build a Console Controller for example Xbox, Playstation etc.
   - Bottom half of the screen: The remote - You will need to have buttons assigned to an action that when the button is clicked or joystick is activated it should trigger an event.
   - Top half of the screen: Have some sort of haptic feedback model that reacts to the selection on the gamepad controls. -->
<!-- Requirements
   - You need to work as a team!
   - Use github to build out features and push changes
   - Please alternate between each other for features
   - You will have 5 minutes to plan (When I say start)
   - The app should be functional!!! With at least 5 haptic interactions.
   - Technical requirements
    - Pure Functions & components
    - UseState
    - Modular components & pages
    - Readable and nice looking UI
    - Bug proof code (Think switch statements with strings...)
- if needed add two way state functionality -->
